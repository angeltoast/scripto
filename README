Scripto is a simple utility for working in GNU/Linux shell scripts. It lists all functions within a chosen script, and all calls to any chosen function. Selecting a call or function opens the preferred text editor at the call or function line.

Place Scripto somewhere on your PATH to use for any project.

Note that not all editors support the line-finding facility:
... Geany, Nano, Gedit, Vi and Vim are among those that do;
... CodeBlocks, NetBeans, Bluefish are among those that don't.
