Scripto is a programmer's utility for searching for text in a working directory.

Designed for use with bash shell scripts, Scripto will work with any plain text files.

1) You enter text to find, and Scripto searches for it in all files in the current directory;
2) Scripto then displays all occurences, with file names and line numbers;
3) You can then select one and your chosen text editor will open the file at that line.

The ideal situation for Scripto would be in your workshop directory.
Note that Scripto sources the Lister library of simple interfaces for use in a predominantly text-based environment, so make sure that a copy of lister.sh is also present.
A copy is distributed with Scripto for your convenience.

Scripto is kept as basic as possible - you're a programmer, you know what to do.

Note that not all editors support the line-finding facility:
... Geany, Nano, Gedit, Vi and Vim are among those that do;
... CodeBlocks, NetBeans and Bluefish are among those that don't.
