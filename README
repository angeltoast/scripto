Scripto is a simple programmers' utility for Linux users.
It lists all functions within a chosen script, and all calls
to any chosen function. Selecting a call or function opens the 
preferred text editor at the call or function line.
Place Scripto somewhere on your PATH to use for any project.
Note that not all editors support the line-finding facility:
... Geany, Nano, Gedit, Vi and Vim are among those that do
... CodeBlocks, NetBeans, Bluefish are among those that don't
