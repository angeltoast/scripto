Scripto is a programmer's utility for searching for text in a working directory.

Although originally designed for use with bash shell scripts, Scripto will work with any
plain text files in a Linux environment.

Is your source file huge, or is your code spread over several files? Scripto may help.
1) You enter text to find, and Scripto searches for it in all files in the current directory;
2) Scripto then displays all occurences, with file names and line numbers;
3) You can then select one and your chosen text editor will open the file at that line.

You might want to find all calls to a particular function. Enter the function name, and Scripto
will list every line in every file where that name appears. They are grouped by file name, and
listed in line-number order, so you can see how they relate. Do the same for variables. See
where you may have assigned the same variable name more than once, or where its value has been
changed. Used a complex regex and can only remember a bit of it? See if Scripto can find it.

The ideal situation for Scripto would be in your workshop directory - you have one, right?

Note that Scripto sources the Lister library of simple interfaces, written for use in a
text-based environment, so make sure that a copy of lister.sh is also present in your
working directory. A copy of Lister is distributed with Scripto for your convenience.

Scripto is kept as basic as possible - you're a programmer, you know what to do.

Note that not all editors support the line-finding facility:
... Geany, Nano, Gedit, Vi and Vim are among those that do;
... CodeBlocks, NetBeans and Bluefish are among those that don't (Scripto will still
display the lines of text, but the editor won't open at the selected line).
